### Planning Process and Problem-Solving Strategy
If you're here I assume you read the client repo for haiku75. If you haven't, a link can be found above (ðŸ‘†). As I mentioned in the client repo, I love Twitter - but I felt more inclined towards this poetic niche. The real issue was figuring out how many characters were enough characters to still be a challenge but not too much of a challenge that it would annoy users. I changed the amount of max characters many times - in fact, it was originally going to be called haiku51. I settled on a title with a max of _15_ characters; fives with a max of _18_ characters and a seven with a max of _24_ characters.
